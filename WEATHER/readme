‚òÄÔ∏è Basic Weather App
A simple, command-line interface (CLI) application built with Python to fetch and display current weather data for any location worldwide using a powerful third-party weather API.

‚ú® Features
Location Query: Accepts a city name or ZIP code as a command-line argument.

Real-time Data: Fetches the most current weather information.

Key Metrics Display: Shows the following basic weather information:

Temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit).

Humidity percentage.

General weather conditions (e.g., "Clear Sky," "Broken Clouds," "Light Rain").

üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

An API Key from a weather service provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI). This application uses HTTP requests to retrieve data.

üöÄ Installation and Setup
1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/basic-weather-cli.git](https://github.com/your-username/basic-weather-cli.git)
cd basic-weather-cli

2. Install Dependencies
This project requires the requests library for making API calls.

pip install requests

3. Configure API Key (Crucial Step)
For security, the API key should be stored as an environment variable, not directly in the code.

Get your API Key from your chosen weather service.

Set the environment variable named WEATHER_API_KEY in your terminal session.

For Linux/macOS:

export WEATHER_API_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_HERE"

For Windows (Command Prompt):

set WEATHER_API_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_HERE"

üí° Usage
Run the script by providing the location (city name or ZIP code) as a positional argument.

By City Name
python weather_cli.py "London, UK"

By ZIP Code (Example for US)
python weather_cli.py 90210

üìã Example Output
A successful run will display a formatted output like the following:

======================================
